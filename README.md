Welcome to Frogger Clone

Rules:

Move the player to the ocean, so that he can escape the evil bugs.

Using the ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘top’, and ‘down’, move the player to dodge 
and jump in the ocean.

When the player jumps in the ocean the game will restart and if the player
gets hit by the bug the game will also restart.

Good Luck!
